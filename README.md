# CosineNeuralFit
Neural Network for Cosine Curve Fitting

Detailed Description:
This repository contains code for training a neural network to fit the function cos(x/2). The neural network is designed to learn the underlying patterns of the cosine curve and make accurate predictions. The code includes the definition of the neural network architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. Explore the capabilities of neural networks in capturing and approximating the behavior of the cos(x/2) function through this practical implementation.
